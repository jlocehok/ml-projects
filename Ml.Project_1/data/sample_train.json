All three bedrooms have oversized windows, get excellent natural light, and can easily fit queen sized beds. The kitchen was finished with new cabinetry, white granite countertops, and top of the line stainless steel appliances including an installed microwave. The living area is generous and an absolute pleasure to hangout in with the extra ceiling height. Laundry is located downstairs in the basement, shared with just 3 other units. The absolute standout feature in this unit are built in Bluetooth speakers throughout the home. It's as easy as connecting your phone      to the Bluetooth device in your unit, and you can bump tunes throughout the whole apartment! This neighborhood is exploding with activity. For starters, the Halsey L train is just 300 ft from your front door with service to Union Sq in Manhattan in about 20 minutes. If you're concerned about L train closures, the M train is also just 10 minutes away at Myrtle\/Wyckoff.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.Why do we use it?It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).Where does it come from?Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translatio ","display_address":"East 49th Street","features":["Doorman","Fitness Center","Dogs Allowed","Cats Allowed"],"latitude":40.7539,"listing_id":7144584,"longitude":-73.9677,"manager_id":"70c9035cc23844487e1754b0d58577f5","photos":[],"price":3700,"street_address":"333 East 49th Street","interest_level":"low"},{"bathrooms":1.0,"bedrooms":3,"building_id":"fee4d465932160318364d9d48d272879","created":"2016-06-16 06:06:15","description":"LOW FEE apartments do not come around like this! *IN UNIT LAUNDRY!!***Low-fee units are more and more hard-to-get in this competitive market, but here's a good chance.This is your next rental.

It's a top-floor, spacious, recently renovated, quiet, one bedroom and the Upper East Side neighborhood is lovely. I recommend you schedule a viewing ASAP. Rentals like this don't last.\r\rYou'll love the rental's hardwood floors throughout and large, sound proof, thermal windows. Nice touches add to the apartment's lovely feel including high ceilings.\r\rThe apartment comes with heat\/hot included. The unit also has recessed lighting. The rental is nice and sunny.\r\rThe apartment's kitchen was gut renovated and features granite countertops and a window that opens. You'll find a gas range, a full-sized fridge, plenty of storage, high-end appliances, and a gas oven.\r\rThe bedroom has a window that opens, good storage, and hardwood flooring. You should have space for a king sized bed in the nicely sized bedroom, but Remember to bring a tape measure during the showing.\r\rThe bathroom was recently renovated and has granite finishes, a standard tub, and a medicine cabinet.\r\rIt's rare in NYC, at this price range, to find a building that's leasing up fast, rarely available, loved by tenants, and well maintained. This building is exactly that. The full amenity list includes: a great super, a front door buzzer, and clean and lighted hallways.\r\rPlease contact me today for other questions.
